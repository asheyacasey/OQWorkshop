        applications.

      <article class="work">
        <h3 class="work-title"><strong>Films:</strong> I live for them</h3>
       <!---<p class="work-dates">February 2019 - Present</p>-->
        <p>
            She enjoy watching movies, TV shows, and other forms of entertainment.
            To say, she love them is an understatement; not only love them, but live for them. 
            When she sees something she enjoy, she's taken to a new universe where she introduced to new people that are incredibly fascinating. 
            It's as though you're hanging out with a fresh bunch of pals.
            She find herself listening to their ideas, smiling at their jokes, crying at their tragedies, and biting her nails as they struggle.

        <h3 class="work-title"><strong>Ambivert:</strong> I Don't Know Where I Belong</h3>
        <!--<p class="work-dates">June 2015 - January 2019</p>-->
        <p>She's loud and fun to a few but mostly quite to a lot. An ambivert she was, a pour of drizzle of an outgoing kid and a hurricane of a lone wolf in the social club. 
            She project herself as a woman who looked at the bright side but deep down, the cloud of confusion are hunting her and thats when she's starting to feel negatively towards the world. 
            But she trust in God, wholeheartedly and she prays that her pessimistic side will gone by the moment she's starting to feel it.
            Most of all, she may looked fragile but she has all the card on her palm under the table that makes every pages of her story unpredictable.</p>

        <h3 class="work-title"><strong>I am:</strong> The Main Character</h3>
      <!--- <p class="work-dates">January 2017 - May 2017</p>-->
        <p>Knowing her, she has a very depth personality and she continues to wander that sometimes it makes her insane (figuratively). 
            The way her mind work is a bit bizzaro that she sees the world differently. 
            She has the soul of a lady that was living in 80's who dance around the street of Paris at midnight with the man of her life. 
            Her character can be read on novels, a sincere heart who are passionate to create art and wrote poems. 
            She's a free spirit gal who love to listen from Air Supply and Carpenter's album to a new modern hipster playlist. </p>
